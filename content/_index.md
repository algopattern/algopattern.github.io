# Algorithmic Pattern

Alpaca is a site for exploring Algorithmic Pattern, based both on-line
and as a growing research studio between Sheffield and Penryn UK,
emerging from the [ERC PENELOPE](https://penelope.hypotheses.org/)
project, within the [FoAM Kernow](https://fo.am/studios/kernow/)
bubble.

Alpaca are wonderful animals whose fleeces produce fantastic wool,
which is as important for exploring algorithmic patterns as
silicon. Alpaca is also short for the Algorithmic Pattern Catalog, an
idea which we plan to get going soon.

For now, we have a [forum](https://forum.alpaca.lurk.org/), exploring
readings around algorithmic patterns.
