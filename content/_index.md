# Algorithmic Pattern

Alpaca is a laboratory for Algorithmic Pattern, based on-line and
hopefully one day as a physical research lab in Sheffield UK, emerging
from the [ERC PENELOPE](https://penelope.hypotheses.org/) project,
within the [FoAM Kernow](https://fo.am/studios/kernow/) bubble.

Alpaca are wonderful animals whose fleeces produce fantastic wool,
which is as important for exploring algorithmic patterns as
silicon. Alpaca is also short for the Algorithmic Pattern Catalog, an
idea which we hope to get going over the next couple of years.

For now, we have a [forum](https://forum.alpaca.lurk.org/), exploring
readings around algorithmic patterns.
