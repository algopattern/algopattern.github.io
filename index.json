	"content": "Algorithmic Pattern Alpaca is a laboratory for Algorithmic Pattern, based on-line and hopefully one day as a physical research lab in Sheffield UK, emerging from the ERC PENELOPE project, within the FoAM Kernow bubble.\nAlpaca are wonderful animals whose fleeces produce fantastic wool, which is as important for exploring algorithmic patterns as silicon. Alpaca is also short for the Algorithmic Pattern Catalog, an idea which we hope to get going over the next couple of years.\nFor now, we have a forum, exploring readings around algorithmic patterns.\n"
